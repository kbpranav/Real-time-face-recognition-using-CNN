# Real-time-face-recognition-using-CNN
Deep learning algorithm Convolutional neural networks with opencv has been used to design face recognition system.

Working: The real-time input image captured from camera is first fed to Viola Jones algorithm for face detection. The cropped face image is then resized to 150Ã—150 pixels and fed to the CNN model for recognition of the class.

Dataset_gen.py : It is used to create customized dataset for the application with each class having 1000 images for training and 500 images for testing.
The Structure of the dataset :

-/dataset/

    -/train/
    
        -/1/
        
        -/2/
        
        -/3/
        
        -/4/
    -/test/
    
        -/1
                
        -/2/
        
        -/3/
        
        -/4/

Necessary packages to run:
1. Keras
2. Numpy
3. opencv-python
4. tkinter
5. time
6. os
